# What needs to be done

- After cloning the repository, we would like you to complete all the endpoints that you can find in `routes/todo.js`

- Please try to separate your commits per feature.

- Try to deliver your code as if it's going to be deployed in production just after.

- After you finish, provide us back with the link of your repository, so we can evaluate your work.
